/*
Guess the Number Game

Problem:
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
The user must guess the number in a limited number of tries (variable), receiving feedback:
- "Too low!" if the guess is below the number
- "Too high!" if the guess is above the number
- "Correct!" if the guess is right

If the user has lost, return "You have lost!" every time a guess is tried
If the user won, return "You have won!" every time a guess is tried

Input: integers from user input (guesses)
Output: feedback strings

Implement the Guess function that would pass the tests, as well as a
command line user interface that would generate a game (with user given
max retries), generate a secret random number, then let the user play the game.
